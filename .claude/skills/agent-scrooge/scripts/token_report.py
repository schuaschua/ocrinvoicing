"""Token usage for this project by work item (story or planning phase), step and activity.

Reads Claude Code's own session logs for the project (~/.claude/projects/<project root with every
non-alphanumeric character as "-">/: one .jsonl per session, plus subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl and
.meta.json per agent) and writes six files to <out-dir> (default: the org config's
token_usage_folder, else <project>/docs/costing/token_usage/):

  token_usage.csv                one row per work item x day x step x activity x model
  token_usage_summary.csv        planning phases; each story as a total plus six activity rows
  token_usage_summary_final.csv  planning phases; all stories combined into six activity rows; each epic's
                                 stories; with the Claude API budget, actual (USD) and variance where budgeted
  report.md                      the same data as readable tables
  claude_usage.csv               tokens by type per work item x model, with first and last call time
                                 (for Claude API pricing, the project timeline and dashboards)
  claude_usage_daily.csv         the same per day, with cost_usd at Claude API list prices when
                                 <project>/_bmad/memory/agent-scrooge/claude-prices.json exists (claude_prices.py --save)

Every API call is counted once (deduplicated by message id) and attributed three ways:
  work item  a story (a Jira key such as PROJ-18; the key comes from --key, else the org config's
             jira_project_key, else the story map), from the agent's description (Jira key or
             story number), the agent that started it, or the call's git branch; else a planning
             phase from the skill running at the time, the planning files a call touched, or a
             planning agent's description; else ops (merges, promotions, deploys on dev/main) or other.
  step       the agent's job: main session, build (orchestrating), implement, review, explore,
             context, testing, planning agent.
  activity   the tool the call used: writing code, writing tests, running tests & checks, writing
             docs/specs, reading/shell, git/PR/Jira, MCP tools, delegating, thinking/reporting.
  category   the six the summaries split each story into: AI comprehension (reading / shell), AI reasoning
             (thinking / reporting, docs/specs, delegating), Writing code, Writing tests, Running tests and
             checks, and MCP usage (git / Jira / PR and every MCP server call).

Cost units weight each token type against one fresh input token (cache read 0.1, 5-minute cache
write 1.25, 1-hour cache write 2, output 5): relative, not dollars, every model alike.

Prints JSON to stdout: the files written, call and unit totals, and with --story KEY that story's
cost by step and activity plus a one-line summary for its pull request and Jira comment.
Project data (optional, kept out of the installed skill so updates never overwrite it), in
<project>/_bmad/memory/agent-scrooge/:
  stories.json   {"stories": {"PROJ-18": ["2.3", "Choose a product"], ...}}: story numbers and titles
  savings.json   {"savings": {"<row>": "<suggestion>", ...}}: replaces or adds suggested savings
  token-budgets.json  {"currency": "USD", "phases": {"test design": 40, ...}, "epics": {"1": 150, ...}, "cite": "..."}:
                 the Claude API budget per planning phase and per epic, in USD at Claude API list prices; the
                 final summary and report.md compare it with the actual (needs claude-prices.json)

Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 error (no log folder, unreadable input).
