# Cloud Deployment

Shows where the containers run in the cloud: the regions, subscriptions, resource groups and networks, and the cloud services that host each part. The group kinds below are Azure's; Azure is the provider the kit ships a stencil catalogue for today. A reviewer reads it for hosting, network isolation and data residency, so a region or network boundary drawn without a source is worse than a missing one.

- **Cloud services** (`service`): each resource a source names (App Service, Functions, Azure OpenAI, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, Front Door), labelled with the resource type and, in `description`, what it hosts ("hosts Chat API").
- **Icons**: set the model's `provider` (`azure`), then find each service's stencil with `uv run scripts/stencils.py search azure <service name>` and put its `id` in the node's `icon` (for example `databases/Azure_Cosmos_DB`). Pick a stencil whose title names that service; the first match isn't always it (a search for "AI Search" returns "Serverless Search" first). If none names the service, leave `icon` out and the service is drawn as a labelled box. `uv run scripts/stencils.py list` shows the providers that have a catalogue.
- **Groups**, nested with `parent`, each drawn only when a source states it: `region` (with the region name; with no region stated, no box at all, not even a generic "Azure region", and the region goes in the gaps), `subscription`, `resource_group`, `vnet`, `subnet`, and `boundary` for anything else a source draws, such as a landing zone.
- **Users and outside systems** (`person`, `external`) where traffic enters or leaves.
- **On-premises** (`on_premises` group): the organisation's own data centre and what a source places in it, such as source systems or a data warehouse (`external` nodes), drawn apart from the `cloud` group. The link between them (VPN, ExpressRoute, a self-hosted integration runtime or data gateway) is drawn only when a source names it; otherwise it's a gap, and a sharp one, since every on-premises flow crosses it.
- **Connections**: ingress, private endpoints, VNet integration and outbound calls, each labelled and cited; `dashed` for private link or peering when the source says so.

## Drawing rules

These are the org's conventions for every deployment diagram, so diagrams from different projects read the same way.

- **A service that hosts workloads is a box with that service's icon.** An AKS cluster, App Service plan or Container Apps environment is a `boundary` group with `icon` set to its stencil (`compute/Kubernetes_Services` for AKS), and the workloads it runs are nodes inside it.
- **Workloads get a container icon.** Each app or service running in AKS is a node with `icon: "kubernetes:pod"` (use `kubernetes:deploy` when a source speaks of deployments); workloads in Container Apps use the Azure container app stencil. The label says what the workload is and its technology in `tech` (React, .NET).
- **Data services never sit inside a compute cluster.** Cosmos DB, SQL, Storage and similar managed services are drawn beside the cluster, not in it. When a source places them in the network, each sits in its own `subnet`, apart from the cluster's subnet, inside the region's `vnet`. If the spine puts a database inside a cluster, challenge it before drawing.
- **Multi-region means one set of boxes per region, all inside one large box.** Draw a `region` group for each region, each holding the same structure (network, cluster, workloads, data), and put every region inside one enclosing `cloud` group labelled for the provider ("Azure"). Global services that sit in front of the regions, such as Front Door, Traffic Manager and DNS, go inside the `cloud` group but outside the regions. Name each region as the spine does; when the spine says multi-region without naming or counting them, draw two, labelled "Region 1" and "Region 2", and keep "which regions, and how many" in the gaps. Give the repeated nodes a per-region id (`web-r1`, `web-r2`) and the same cites. The build refuses two or more regions that aren't enclosed in one group.


Gaps this diagram usually turns up: region and failover region; which services sit inside the VNet and which are public; resource-group layout; where secrets live; environments (dev/test/prod) the spine doesn't separate.
